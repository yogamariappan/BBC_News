# BBC News Text Classification and Visualization

This repository contains code for performing text classification and visualization on a dataset of BBC News articles.
The project covers various aspects, including data loading, visualization, text preprocessing, and training machine learning models for classification.

## Overview

The primary goal is to gain insights into the BBC News dataset, understand the distribution of news across different categories, and build models to classify articles based on their content. Additionally,
the project involves visualizing the data using bar plots and word clouds to enhance understanding.

### Usage

### 1. Data Loading and Visualization

Explore the dataset by running the Jupyter Notebook (data_visualization.ipynb). Load the dataset and visualize it using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### 2. Text Preprocessing

Preprocess text data using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for tasks such as **lowercase conversion, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and lemmatization.**

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

Train and evaluate text classification models, such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, on the preprocessed data.

### 4. Additional Visualizations

Create visualizations, including class-wise word clouds, to gain further insights into the content distribution.
